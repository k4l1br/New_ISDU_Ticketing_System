# Admin Edit Ticket Removal

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to remove edit ticket functionality for admin users, restricting editing capabilities to super_admin users only.

## Changes Made

### 1. Controller Updates
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/ticketController.php`

**Method**: `edit(Ticket $ticket)`
- **Before**: Admin users could access edit form if ticket was assigned to their unit or name
- **After**: Only super_admin users can access edit form
- **Change**: Simplified access control to `if (!$user->isSuperAdmin())` with 403 abort

**Method**: `update(Request $request, Ticket $ticket)`
- **Status**: Already restricted to super_admin only (no changes needed)

### 2. View Updates
**File**: `resources/views/shared/tickets/index.blade.php`

**Action Buttons**: 
- **Status**: Already properly configured with role-based display
- **Super Admin**: Shows edit button (yellow warning button)
- **Admin**: Shows view button (blue info button)

**Modal Footer**:
- **Status**: Already properly configured with role-based buttons
- **Super Admin**: Shows "Edit Ticket" button
- **Admin**: Shows "View Full Details" button

### 3. User Experience Changes

#### For Super Admin Users:
- ✅ Can create new tickets
- ✅ Can edit all tickets (full form access)
- ✅ Can update all ticket fields
- ✅ Can delete tickets
- ✅ Can view all tickets

#### For Admin Users:
- ❌ Cannot create tickets
- ❌ Cannot edit tickets (403 error if attempting direct access)
- ❌ Cannot update tickets
- ❌ Cannot delete tickets
- ✅ Can view tickets assigned to their unit/name
- ✅ Can use quick view modal
- ✅ Can access full details view (read-only)

### 4. Security Implementation

**Access Control Method**: Role-based restrictions at controller level
**Error Handling**: 403 Forbidden response for unauthorized access attempts
**Frontend Protection**: Role-based UI rendering (buttons hidden for non-authorized users)

### 5. Routes Affected

| Route | Super Admin | Admin | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------|
| `ticket.index` | ✅ Full Access | ✅ Filtered View | Admin sees only assigned tickets |
| `ticket.create` | ✅ Allowed | ❌ 403 Error | Create restricted to super_admin |
| `ticket.show` | ✅ All Tickets | ✅ Assigned Only | Read-only access |
| `ticket.edit` | ✅ All Tickets | ❌ 403 Error | **Newly restricted** |
| `ticket.update` | ✅ All Tickets | ❌ 403 Error | Already restricted |
| `ticket.destroy` | ✅ All Tickets | ❌ Not Available | Delete restricted |

### 6. Testing Recommendations

1. **Super Admin Testing**:
   - Verify can still edit all tickets
   - Confirm full form functionality
   - Test update operations

2. **Admin Testing**:
   - Confirm edit buttons are not visible
   - Verify 403 error when accessing edit URLs directly
   - Test view-only functionality works correctly

3. **URL Protection Testing**:
   - Try accessing `/ticket/{id}/edit` as admin user
   - Should receive 403 Forbidden error

### 7. Technical Notes

**Authentication Method**: Laravel's built-in Auth facade
**Role Checking**: Custom methods in User model (`isSuperAdmin()`, `isAdmin()`)
**Error Handling**: Laravel's `abort(403)` with custom message
**View Rendering**: Blade conditionals (`@if(auth()->user()->isSuperAdmin())`)

## Summary

Admin users now have **read-only access** to tickets assigned to their unit/name, while super_admin users retain full CRUD capabilities. This enhances security by preventing unauthorized modifications while maintaining appropriate access levels for different user roles.
