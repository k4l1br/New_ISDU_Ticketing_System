## Overview
Successfully removed edit ticket functionality for **admin users only** while preserving full edit capabilities for **super_admin users**.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ What's Implemented

#### For Admin Users (Restricted):
- ❌ **No Edit Button** - Edit buttons are hidden in the UI
- ❌ **No Edit Route Access** - 403 error when accessing edit URLs directly
- ❌ **No Update Permissions** - Cannot modify tickets even if they bypass frontend

- ✅ **Update Permissions** - Can save changes to tickets
- ✅ **Create & Delete** - Complete CRUD operations
- ✅ **All View Options** - Edit, view, and modal access

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### 1. Controller Level Protection
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/ticketController.php`
- `edit()` method: Restricted to super_admin only
- `update()` method: Restricted to super_admin only
- Returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized users

#### 2. Route Level Protection  
**File**: `routes/web.php`
- Edit and update routes moved to super_admin-only middleware group
- Provides additional security layer

#### 3. UI Level Protection
**File**: `resources/views/shared/tickets/index.blade.php`
- Edit buttons only visible for super_admin users
- Admin users see view-only buttons
- Modal footers show appropriate actions based on role

### 🎯 User Experience

#### Admin User Interface:
```
Actions Available:
- [👁️ View] [🔍 Quick View]
Modal Footer: [Close] [👁️ View Full Details]
```

#### Super Admin User Interface:
```
Actions Available:
- [✏️ Edit] [👁️ View] [🔍 Quick View] [🗑️ Delete]
Modal Footer: [Close] [✏️ Edit Ticket]
```

### 🔒 Security Layers

1. **Frontend Protection**: Role-based button visibility
2. **Route Protection**: Middleware restrictions
3. **Controller Protection**: Method-level access control
4. **Database Protection**: Validation rules and authorization

### 📋 Testing Checklist

### 🎉 Result
